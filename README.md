Hey there!👋 My name is Polina and I began my coding journey back in December 2023.

📚 So far, I've been using codecademy to learn: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. To level up my skills, I am working on upgrading my first client's accounting websites and for myself I am creating a Node.JS webapp using Express and mySQL for budgeting.

⏭️ Next on my journey, I am excited to dive into putting all the knowledge I've gained into practice. I'll be honing my skills in front-end work while expanding my expertise to cover back-end development, server management, and database integration. 

🤩 As for my interests, I enjoy country and rap music (though I prefer to keep these genres separate). Dogs and horses hold a special place in my heart as my favorite animals. Moreover, my ultimate aspiration is to own a homestead. 
      I developed a strong passion for coding as it allows me to express my creativity and bring my project ideas to life, specifically I want to work on my own smart home system with my husband.

🌐 I am fluent in 3 languages: English, French, and Russian; I also know a bit of German and Spanish. 
      Additionally, I hold dual citizenship - 🟥🍁🟥 / ⚪️🔵🔴

💻 I'm currently seeking a remote internship opportunity in front-end development or database management. 
      Moreover, I am open to collaborating with business owners to create their custom website, while also enhancing their metrics through SEO optimization and analytics.
